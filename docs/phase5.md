# Phase 5: Project Refinement and Structural Improvements

## Major Refactoring and Improvements

### Project Structure Reorganization
- Restructured project into a proper Python package under `src/nyc_rental_price/`
- Organized code into logical modules:
  - `data/`: Data processing and scraping utilities
  - `models/`: Neural network model definitions
  - `api/`: FastAPI implementation
- Created proper `__init__.py` files for package initialization

### Test Suite Enhancement
- Reorganized tests into a clearer structure:
  ```
  tests/
  ├── unit/
  │   └── test_scraper.py
  ├── integration/
  └── performance/
  ```
- Implemented comprehensive unit tests for the Scraper class
- Added test fixtures for model testing in conftest.py

### Model Implementation
- Created robust model.py with:
  - `create_model()`: Configurable neural network architecture
  - `save_model()`: Model persistence functionality
  - `load_model()`: Model loading utility
- Implemented dropout layers for better regularization
- Added configurable hyperparameters for model customization

### Data Processing Improvements
- Enhanced preprocessing.py with:
  - Standardized data cleaning pipeline
  - Proper handling of categorical variables
  - Feature scaling and normalization
- Improved Scraper class implementation with:
  - Robust HTML parsing
  - Error handling for network requests
  - Data validation during scraping

### Dependencies Management
- Updated pyproject.toml with:
  - Core dependencies: tensorflow, scikit-learn, requests, beautifulsoup4
  - Development dependencies: pytest, black, flake8
- Organized setup.py for proper package installation

### Version Control
- Created v0.1.0 tag marking the major restructuring
- Maintained clean commit history with descriptive messages
- Updated .gitignore for proper file exclusions

## Impact of Changes

### Improved Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns in code organization
- Better test coverage for critical components
- Standardized code style and documentation

### Enhanced Reliability
- Robust error handling in data collection
- Comprehensive test suite ensuring functionality
- Proper dependency management preventing conflicts

### Better Developer Experience
- Clear project structure for easier navigation
- Comprehensive documentation of components
- Streamlined development setup process

## Next Steps

1. **API Enhancement**
   - Implement additional endpoints for model management
   - Add request validation and error handling
   - Include API documentation using FastAPI's built-in tools

2. **Model Optimization**
   - Experiment with different architectures
   - Implement model versioning
   - Add model performance monitoring

3. **Data Pipeline Enhancement**
   - Add data validation checks
   - Implement data versioning
   - Create automated data update pipeline

4. **Documentation**
   - Add detailed API documentation
   - Create developer guides for each component
   - Include example notebooks for common use cases
