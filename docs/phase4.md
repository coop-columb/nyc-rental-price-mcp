## Phase 4: Deployment Documentation

### API Creation, Dockerization, and Deployment

**Objective:**
Deploy MCP-based model via FastAPI with Docker, integrated into GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

**Docker Containerization:**
- Dockerfile provided at repository root for consistent container builds across platforms.
- Ensure Docker Desktop (for Mac Silicon) is installed.

**CI/CD Pipeline:**
- GitHub Actions workflow (`ci-cd.yml`) automates tests and Docker image building/pushing.
- Utilizes macOS runners to maintain compatibility with Apple Silicon architecture.

**Secrets Management:**
- Docker credentials (`DOCKER_USERNAME`, `DOCKER_PASSWORD`) must be securely stored in GitHub Secrets for automated Docker Hub authentication during deployments.

**Best Practices:**
- Keep Docker images lightweight (slim Python base images recommended).
- Maintain detailed logging for ease of debugging and maintenance.
- Regularly test your CI/CD pipeline by pushing minor updates to ensure reliability.
