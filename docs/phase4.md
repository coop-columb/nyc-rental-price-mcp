## Phase 4: Deployment Documentation

### API Creation, Dockerization, and Deployment

**Objective:**
Deploy MCP-based model via FastAPI with Docker, integrated into GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

**Docker Containerization:**
- Dockerfile provided at repository root for consistent container builds across platforms.
- Ensure Docker Desktop (for Mac Silicon) is installed.

**CI/CD Pipeline:**
- GitHub Actions workflow (`ci-cd.yml`) automates tests and Docker image building/pushing.
- Utilizes macOS runners to maintain compatibility with Apple Silicon architecture.

**Secrets Management:**
- Docker credentials (`DOCKER_USERNAME`, `DOCKER_PASSWORD`) must be securely stored in GitHub Secrets for automated Docker Hub authentication during deployments.

**Best Practices:**
- Keep Docker images lightweight (slim Python base images recommended).
- Maintain detailed logging for ease of debugging and maintenance.
- Regularly test your CI/CD pipeline by pushing minor updates to ensure reliability.


### Recent Improvements

**CI/CD Workflow Enhancements:**
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to include robust Docker Hub authentication using docker/login-action
- Added proper job dependencies to ensure sequential execution of test, build, and deploy stages
- Implemented build caching to improve CI pipeline performance
- Added deployment options for multiple cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) with placeholders for future configuration

**Dependency Management:**
- Fixed requirements.txt file to ensure proper specification of package versions
- Added all necessary dependencies for testing and model generation
- Ensured compatibility between packages to prevent dependency conflicts

**Testing Improvements:**
- Implemented comprehensive test suite with proper assertions
- Created tests for model functionality, data preprocessing, and web scraping
- Added test fixtures and mocks to avoid external dependencies during testing
- Ensured all tests are automatically executed in the CI pipeline

**Model Integration:**
- Added placeholder model file for testing purposes (models/best_mcp_model.h5)
- Configured .gitignore exceptions to include model files in version control
- Ensured model loading and prediction functions are properly tested

**Best Practices Implemented:**
- Separated CI/CD pipeline into logical stages (test, build, deploy)
- Implemented proper error handling and reporting in the workflow
- Added detailed logging for all CI/CD stages
- Ensured secrets are properly managed through GitHub Secrets
