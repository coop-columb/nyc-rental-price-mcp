# Project Build Notes

This document contains meticulous notes on all restructuring actions performed so far in this project.

## Initial Restructuring (Timestamp: 2025-03-30T22:48:41-04:00)

1. **Created Root-Level README.md**
   - Contains the project overview and a description of the new folder structure.

2. **Created docs/README.md**
   - A placeholder for additional documentation.

3. **Reorganized the src/ Folder**
   - Moved API code from `src/nyc_rental_price/api/` to `src/api/`.
   - Moved data processing code from `src/nyc_rental_price/data/` to `src/data_processing/`.
   - Moved model-related code from `src/nyc_rental_price/models/` to `src/models/`.

4. **Removed Redundant Directories**
   - Deleted empty or redundant directories that were causing confusion (e.g., the duplicate directories in the top-level such as src/app, src/data, src/features, src/models).

5. **Notes:**
   - Placeholder notes have been added in the moved files to indicate that their content remains unchanged aside from relocation.
   - The old directories now being empty have been removed to improve clarity.
   - This restructuring aims to consolidate the code in a clear, single package (`nyc_rental_price`) now distributed as `src/api`, `src/data_processing`, and `src/models`.

## Next Steps

- Validate that all functionalities remain intact after restructuring.
- Continue documenting any further restructuring or cleanup operations.
- Update all README files to reflect the new structure, guiding future development and contributions.
