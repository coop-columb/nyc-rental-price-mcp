# Project Structure Cleanup Changes

This document outlines the changes made to clean up the project structure and improve Git practices.

## 1. Directory Structure Cleanup

### Removed Duplicate Directories
- Removed `src/models` (duplicate of `src/nyc_rental_price/models`)
- Removed `src/api` (duplicate of `src/nyc_rental_price/api`)
- Removed `src/app` (empty directory with only `__init__.py`)
- Removed `src/data_processing` (duplicate of `src/nyc_rental_price/data`)

### Consolidated Test Files
- Removed duplicate test files at the root level of `tests/`
- Moved `tests/test_setup.py` to `tests/integration/test_setup.py`
- Renamed `tests/performance/test_performance_fixed.py` to `tests/performance/test_performance.py`
- Removed the old `tests/performance/test_performance.py`

## 2. Git Configuration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- Added CI workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Set up jobs for testing and linting
- Configured matrix testing for Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11

## 3. Project Structure

The project now follows a cleaner structure:

```
nyc-rental-price-mcp/
├── .github/            # GitHub configuration files
│   └── workflows/      # GitHub Actions workflows
├── data/               # Data files
│   ├── raw/            # Raw, immutable data
│   ├── interim/        # Intermediate data
│   └── processed/      # Processed data ready for modeling
├── docs/               # Documentation files
├── models/             # Trained models
├── notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks
├── src/                # Source code
│   └── nyc_rental_price/ # Main package
│       ├── api/        # API code
│       ├── data/       # Data processing code
│       ├── features/   # Feature engineering code
│       └── models/     # Model training code
└── tests/              # Test files
    ├── integration/    # Integration tests
    ├── performance/    # Performance tests
    └── unit/           # Unit tests
```

## 4. Next Steps

1. Continue development using the `nyc_rental_price` package in `src/`
2. Run the pre-commit hooks before committing changes
3. Follow the Git workflow described in `docs/git_workflow.md`
4. Use the GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration

## 5. Git Branch Management

You're currently on the `refactor/project-structure` branch. After reviewing these changes:

1. Commit them to the current branch
2. Create a pull request to merge into `main`
3. After merging, continue development on feature branches created from `main`

## 6. Git Best Practices

1. Create feature branches for new functionality
2. Use descriptive commit messages following conventional commits format
3. Run tests before pushing changes
4. Create pull requests for code review
5. Merge to main only after CI passes and code is reviewed
