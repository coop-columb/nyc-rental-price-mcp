# Project Structure Improvements Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to improve the project structure and Git practices.

## Changes Made

### Git Configuration

1. **Enhanced .gitignore**: Added more comprehensive patterns for Python projects
2. **Added .gitattributes**: Set up Git LFS for large files (models, datasets, etc.)
3. **Added .gitkeep files**: To maintain empty directory structure in Git

### GitHub Integration

1. **Pull Request Template**: Added a standardized PR template
2. **Issue Templates**: Added templates for bug reports and feature requests
3. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Added CI/CD pipeline for testing and linting

### Development Setup

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Added configuration for code quality checks
2. **Updated pyproject.toml**: Enhanced configuration for development tools
3. **Updated setup.py**: Added comprehensive development dependencies

### Documentation

1. **Added CONTRIBUTING.md**: Guidelines for contributing to the project
2. **Added Git Workflow Documentation**: Detailed branching strategy and commit guidelines
3. **Improved Project Structure Documentation**: Added clearer directory organization

## Best Practices Implemented

### Git Workflow

- **Branch Strategy**: Using feature branches for development
- **Commit Guidelines**: Following Conventional Commits specification
- **Pull Request Process**: Standardized PR template and review process
- **Large File Handling**: Git LFS for models and datasets

### Code Quality

- **Linting and Formatting**: Black, Ruff, isort, mypy
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated checks before committing
- **Testing Framework**: Enhanced pytest configuration

### Project Organization

- **Standard Directory Structure**: Following Python package best practices
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive project documentation
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and quality checks

## Next Steps

1. **Install pre-commit hooks**: Run `pre-commit install` to enable the hooks
2. **Set up Git LFS**: Run `git lfs install` if not already set up
3. **Create develop branch**: Consider creating a develop branch for integration
4. **Update documentation**: Keep documentation up to date with project changes
5. **Review and merge**: Review these changes and merge to main branch

## Conclusion

These changes establish a solid foundation for collaborative development using Git best practices. The improved structure will make the project more maintainable, easier to contribute to, and better aligned with industry standards.
